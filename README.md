- TCP, UDP, and IP Protocols
- IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Ports and Port Forwarding
- Subnetting and CIDR Notation
- Routing and NAT
- DNS Configuration
- VPN for Secure Communication
- Essential Networking Tools

---

## **How to Use This Document**
1. **Learning**: Use this guide as a reference for understanding networking concepts step-by-step.
2. **Practical Applications**: Implement the provided examples in your daily DevOps workflows.
3. **Troubleshooting**: Refer to specific sections to resolve network-related issues in cloud or local environments.

---

## **Networking Concepts**
### **1. OSI Model**
- Learn about the 7 layers of the OSI model and their roles in networking.
- [Detailed Explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)

### **2. Networking Protocols**
- Understand TCP, UDP, and IP protocols with real-world examples.
- Learn the differences between connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) communication.

### **3. What is an IP Address?**
- Learn about IPv4 and IPv6 addressing formats (e.g., `123.123.1.231`).
- Understand private vs public IP addresses and their uses.

### **4. Ports**
- Explore the role of ports in networking and their importance for DevOps tasks.
- Examples: Ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 22 (SSH).

### **5. Subnetting**
- Dive into subnetting and CIDR notation to manage IP spaces efficiently.

### **6. Routing**
- Understand how routing works and how to configure routing tables for cloud and local networks.

### **7. DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Learn how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.

### **8. VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
- Explore how VPNs create secure communication tunnels over the internet.

---

## **9. Networking Tools**
Master essential tools for DevOps networking:
- `ping`: Test connectivity.
- `traceroute`: Track the path of packets.
- `netstat`: View active network connections.
- `nmap`: Discover hosts and services.
- `tcpdump`: Capture and analyze network traffic.
- `Wireshark`: Visualize and troubleshoot network interactions.

---

## **Advanced Networking Topics**
1. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Map private IPs to public IPs for internet access.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers for redundancy.
3. **Firewalls**: Secure networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

---

## **Practical Scenarios**
1. Configuring CI/CD pipelines for secure artifact deployments across regions.
2. Troubleshooting Docker container communication issues.
3. Setting up secure VPN access to remote cloud environments.
